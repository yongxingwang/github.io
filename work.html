    <section id="graph-benchmark">
        <header> <strong> Development of A Hair Model</strong> </header>
        <p> 
		The project aims at developing a material model to describe hair/beard in order to simulate shaving process, with implementation using Abaqus VUMAT. The whole simulation involves elastic and plastic deformation, as well as structural failure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="clic">
        <header><strong>Software for Metal Forming Processe</strong> </header>
        <p>
            This project is to develop the core finite element algorithm and program in order to create a software for simulating metal forming, which is modelled as a rigid-plastic process with frictional contact with the mould. This model is also coupled with heat transfer by conduction and radiation. The algorithm has been validated against the results of software DEFORM-3D, via two benchmarks (upsetting and indirect extrusion) and one die forging process from engineering.
        </p>

    <section id="archetipum">
        <header><strong>Simulation of Complex Fluids and Heat Transfer Inside An Larege Autoclave</strong> </header>
        <p>
         The purpose of this project is to look at the distribution of velocity and temperature inside the autoclave in order to optimally locate a composite material. A k-\epsilon turbulence model coupled with the heat equation was used to describe the fluid and temperature field. The heat was convected quickly by the fluid, and the distribution of temperature highly depended on the velocity field and temperature of inlet fluid.

        <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
    </header>
	<p>
	I have never been giving up doing research since graduation from university in the year 2004, because that is the goal of my career and it has always been there, although it has taken a long way to arrive here viewing from my working experiences. Actually all the jobs I have been involved are research related. Even the one year in a high school, I had a part-time job doing research: implementing the resistivity inversion method for oil exploration in the Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration.
	</p>

	<p>
After getting my BSc degree in 2004, I went to the Agriculture University of Hebei Province and taught
Calculus, Linear Algebra, etc. Those three years of teaching have greatly enhanced my knowledge of
advanced mathematics. When I felt it was time to learn, I went to Suzhou University to pursue my
Msc degree in 2007. I learnt some further math and majored in studying variational inequality and
meshfree methods, which I applied to the simulation of explosion in the State Key Laboratory of
Explosion Science and Technology.	
	</p>
	
	<p>
The three years in ECTec gave very good researching experiences. Several people worked as team
and we developed FEM algorithms for different kind of problems: heat transfer, solid mechanics, fluid
dynamics, electromagnetism and so on. The one-field idea for FSI problems was just formed at that
time, which has been implemented during my PhD in Leeds.	
	</p>
	
	<p>
As a research fellow in University of Leeds in the past year, I tried to apply the one-field FDM approach
to physical and clinical problems, such as cell simulation and heart simulation.
