            The Graph Database (GDB) comparison is designed to provide comprehensively compare and better understand the existing graph database system solutions.
            It has been developed in collaboration with <a href="https://velgias.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Y. Velgrakis</a> and <a href="https://disi.unitn.it/~lissandrini/" target="_blank">M. Lissandrini</a>.
            The <i>Graph Benchmark</i> made its first appearance in our "Beyond Macrobenchmarks: Microbenchmark-based Graph Database Evaluation" <a href="/research.html#graph-benchmark-vldb19">VLDB19 research paper</a>.

        <p>"CLIC: What if?" is a framework for the simulation for calls for tenders under the Italian regulations.
            It has been developed in collaboration with the faculty of law at the Univesity of Trento,
            within the project "<a href="https://webmagazine.unitn.it/news/ateneo/6889/con-clic-pi-trasparenza-e-valorizzazione-della-qualit-negli-appalti-pubblici" target="_blank">CLIC</a>: Trasparenza e modernizzazione delle procedure di aggiudicazione degli appalti pubblici".</p>

        <header>[2017] <strong>Archetypum</strong> -- <a href="https://rawgit.com/MartinBrugnara/archetypum/master/demo/index_1496998388.html">Demo</a> | <a href="https://github.com/MartinBrugnara/archetypum/blob/master/README.md"><i class="icon-github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="sr">GitHub</span></i></a> (MIT license).</header>
        <p>
            Archetypum is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasulo_algorithm" target="_blank">Tomasulo's protocol</a> visualizer.
            With it, users can design a <i>simple</i> processor and then simulate the execution of an arbitrary assembly program on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The processor comes configured with reasonable settings for a live demo/teaching session.
            The user may then decide anytime to modify any of its capabilities like
            registers, functional units, memory latency, cache, and branch predictor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once completed the customization process, the user shall provide a program to execute.
            They may decide between using one of the examples and write a program in our ARM-like assembly.
            The language supports all the essential instructions, which are also explained in the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it comes the time for the simulation.
            The execution is governed by a clock, with adjustable speed, that the user can stop anytime.
            Once stopped, the user may decide to make it resume or advance cycle by cycle.<br>

            The simulation view provides, besides the clock controls,
            a series of widgets (tables) that display the
            status of each component of the processor.
        </p>
        <p>Archetypum has been developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianluca-bortoli-a572a998/" target="_blank">G. Bortoli</a> as a project for the Advanced Architecture course by <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~roby/" target="_balnk">Prof. R.Passerone</a>.</p>

            This work was conducted as a project for the Distributed Algorithm course by <a href="http://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/" target="_blank">Prof A. Montresor</a>.

            DIP is the result of the Dataset Integration Project: a dataset and process management system for big data.
            It is a novel software address the needs only partially fulfilled by the (at the time) existing solutions (<i>e.g.</i>, CKAN, Oozie).
            This project will be released as a module of a framework that is being developed by the dbTrento group.</p>

            <em>Network.</em> The site connects to the internet via two different ISP, to increase bandwidth (load balancing) and availability (failover).
            Staff and guests can connect to the wifi network that <a href="https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/Request-for-advice-New-outdoor-installation-in-a-Campsite/m-p/1890169/highlight/true#M221835">covers the whole campsite</a> or via cable (from selected locations).
            The wifi coverage is provided via fiber backbones and <a href="https://unifi-mesh.ui.com/" target="_blank">Unifi Mesh APs</a>.
            The traffic generated from different physical locations, like the office, is tagged with dedicated VLAN tags, the same applies to all SSID.
            A <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">PfSense</a> VM is then responsible for the routing and for enforcing QoS rules.
            The router act also as a firewall and provides all essential network services like DHCP, DNS caching, and NTP.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Machines.</em> A Debian hypervisor runs, via KVM, a bunch of VMs that provide various services like the Unifi Controller, the NFS storage server, and the centralized password manager. There are also different workstations all running either Linux Mint or MacOS.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Multi-site Backups.</em> Local backups are managed by a VM, while remote backups rely on a NAS (24TiB, Debian + ZFS).

            The Django Yongxing Camping Administration Utility (DMBCAU)
            is a fully featured framework capable of providing support on every aspect
            of the campings administration.<br>
            It covers basic services like online reservation, confirmation, and billing procedures.
            Obviously, it also generates all documents reports required by law (C59, guests report for police, invoices, ...).
            Furthermore, it provides advanced features like resource (pitches, mobile homes, etc..) allocation optimization and marketing insights.
